# Delimited text to Jira Markup converter

Converts delimited text to Jira markup.
Confluence has macros for this, but pasting into Issues doesn't have this in our installation.

Uses https://github.com/mholt/PapaParse for parsing text into a table.
Uses https://gist.github.com/veganista/6413299 for creating preview html
